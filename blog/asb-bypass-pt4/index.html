    <p>As 2018 rapidly comes to an end, I thought I&rsquo;d close out the year by clearing up some confusions over this AmsiScanBuffer bypass and why it appears to fail under some circumstances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had numerous people contact me (particularly those doing <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/labs/pro/view/1">RastaLabs</a>) asking about these two specific issues, but I didn&rsquo;t feel inspired to address them until a very pleasant conversation with <code>confuciussayuhm</code>.  So props to them :)</p>
<h2 id="it-just-doesnt-work">It Just Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h2>
<p>The first issue looks something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/rastamouse.me-old_blog/images/asb-bypass-pt4/failedbypass.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s visually confusing because the bypass has been executed and allows us to print &ldquo;AmsiScanBuffer&rdquo;, where we previously could not.  But for some reason, the execution of a stager still fails.</p>
<p>By firing up Process Explorer, we can see the PowerShell process our console is living in (semi-highligted in grey).  Then when the IEX cradle is run, a new child PowerShell process is created (highlighted in green) before very quickly being killed off.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/rastamouse.me-old_blog/images/asb-bypass-pt4/procexp.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Because this AMSI bypass is per-process, this new child is still has <code>amsi.dll</code> perfectly intact.  It does not inherit the bypass from its parent, and this is clearly the reason for the detection.</p>
<p>The next question is, why is a child spawned?</p>
<p>Well, by inspecting the two processes in Process Explorer, we see that the path of the child process is <code>c:\Windows\SysWOW64\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe</code>, where the parent is <code>C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</code>.  So this is the 64-bit binary spawning the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>The obvious explanation is that we&rsquo;re trying to run a 32-bit stager from a 64-bit process.  So this is the part where you really need to know your toolset.  For example, the Cobalt Strike Scripted Web Delivery will always create a 32-bit stager (you don&rsquo;t even get the option to make it 64-bit).  Therefore you must ensure that regardless of which toolset you&rsquo;re using, you create 64-bit payloads.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re staged or stageless in the context of this bypass, they both work fine.</p>

<p>I found this one to be a little more interesting.</p>
<p>The second issue comes where the PowerShell process crashes when the bypass is executed, due to some memory corruption.  This would only actually happen if it was being run in a 32-bit process.</p>

<p>If you were using the code we commited in <a href="/rastamouse.me-old_blog/2018/10/amsiscanbuffer-bypass-part-2/">Part 2</a> (which was basically the <a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/AmsiScanBufferBypass/commit/626a27a36196bfe778cbb430b850e43b2ac22b25">initial commit</a>), you would have been using:</p>
<pre><code>Byte[] Patch = { 0x31, 0xff, 0x90 };
IntPtr unmanagedPointer = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(3);
Marshal.Copy(Patch, 0, unmanagedPointer, 3);
MoveMemory(ASBPtr + 0x001b, unmanagedPointer, 3);
</code></pre><p>But at the end of <a href="/rastamouse.me-old_blog/2018/11/amsiscanbuffer-bypass-part-3/">Part 3</a>, we changed the bytes being used to patch the AmsiScanBuffer function, specifically to make it more &ldquo;resiliant&rdquo;.  We ended up with the following, (but I never updated the repo).</p>
<pre><code>Byte[] Patch = { 0xB8, 0x57, 0x00, 0x07, 0x80, 0xC3 };
IntPtr unmanagedPointer = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(6);
Marshal.Copy(Patch, 0, unmanagedPointer, 6);
MoveMemory(ASBPtr, unmanagedPointer, 6);
</code></pre><p>And this runs perfectly well in a 32-bit process.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/rastamouse.me-old_blog/images/asb-bypass-pt4/32bit-fixed.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not tested this, but my theory is that the static byte offset <code>0x001b</code> is incorrect for a 32-bit process, and so we end up overwriting a completely different portion of memory than what we want.</p>
<p>Coincidently, Francesco Soncina submitted two PR&rsquo;s to update both the <a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/AmsiScanBufferBypass/commit/050dae393338ae5b12789b2453b728a93ee1dcd4">C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/AmsiScanBufferBypass/commit/19db77e09f360eda4327b6f4989b8706803b0673">PowerShell</a> versions of the bypass.  So if you pull the changes, you should be fine.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I hope this helps anybody out who was facing these problems.  Armed with this knowledge, may 2019 bring you many more shells.</p>
